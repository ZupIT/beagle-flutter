Although Beagle continues to be mantained for Android, iOS, React and Angular. We're discontinuing Beagle for Flutter. The resons are:
1. Lack of interest from within the company.
2. Lack of interest from the community.
3. Not enough people to reliably mantain the codebase.

This is an Open Source project and everyone is free to fork and mantain it if they wish to. The core Beagle library, used as a dependency by Beagle Flutter, is still mantained at: https://github.com/ZupIT/beagle-web-core.

## **About**
This is the library responsible for rendering a Beagle JSON in Flutter. It is currently in the alpha stage, and most features are yet to be implemented. We welcome any help from the community in making improvements to the API -
which it isn't finished - and implementing features that are missing. You can find the session "State of development" where you will see what we still need to do before releasing a stable version.

## **Documentation**
