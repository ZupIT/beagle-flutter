## **About**
This is the library responsible for rendering a Beagle JSON in Flutter. It is currently in the alpha stage, and most features are yet to be implemented. We welcome any help from the community in making improvements to the API -
which it isn't finished - and implementing features that are missing. You can find the session "State of development" where you will see what we still need to do before releasing a stable version.

## **Documentation**

You can find Beagle's documentation on our [**website**][site].

Beagle's documentation discusses components, APIs, and topics that are specific to [**Beagle documentation**][b-docs].

### **Developer Certificate of Origin - DCO**

 This is a security layer for the project and for the developers. It is mandatory.
 
 Follow one of these two methods to add DCO to your commits:
 
**1. Command line**
 Follow the steps: 
 **Step 1:** Configure your local git environment adding the same name and e-mail configured at your GitHub account. It helps to sign commits manually during reviews and suggestions.

 ```
git config --global user.name “Name”
git config --global user.email “email@domain.com.br”
```

**Step 2:** Add the Signed-off-by line with the `'-s'` flag in the git commit command:

```
$ git commit -s -m "This is my commit message"
```

**2. GitHub website**
You can also manually sign your commits during GitHub reviews and suggestions, follow the steps below: 

**Step 1:** When the commit changes box opens, manually type or paste your signature in the comment box, see the example:

```
Signed-off-by: Name < e-mail address >
```

For this method, your name and e-mail must be the same registered on your GitHub account.
