## **About**
This is the library responsible for rendering a Beagle JSON in Flutter. It is currently in the alpha stage, and most features are yet to be implemented. We welcome any help from the community in making improvements to the API -
which it isn't finished - and implementing features that are missing. You can find the session "State of development" where you will see what we still need to do before releasing a stable version.

## **Documentation**

You can find Beagle's documentation on our [**website**][site].

Beagle's documentation discusses components, APIs, and topics that are specific to [**Beagle documentation**][b-docs].
